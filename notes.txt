~~~~~~ Rules ~~~~~~
each row contains the exact set (1..n^2) in any order
each column contains the exact set (1..n^2) in any order
each subgrid contains the exact (1..n^2) in any order

~~~~~~ Facts ~~~~~~
n^2 x n^2 grid.
grid is divided into n x n subgrids
the sum of numbers in each row,column, or subgrid is the sum of the set: Sum = (n^2)(1+(n^2))/2
the minimum sum of each subgrid row or subgrid column is: MinSubgridSum = n(1+n)/2
the maximum sum of each subgrid row or subgrid column is: MaxSubgridSum = n((n^2-n+1)+n^2)/2
each position has a base probability of 1/n

~~~~~~ Facts about Guessing ~~~~~~  (A guess is an attempt to place a number in any position of the grid)
A guess reduces the amount of remaining guesses in the row by 1
A guess reduces the amount of remaining guesses in the column by 1
A guess reduces the amount of remaining guesses in the subgrid by 1
No other position in the row may use the same number as the guess
No other position in the column may use the same number as the guess
No other position in the subgrid may use the same number as the guess
A guess increases the probability of row, subgrid, and column "partner" positions by:
    (1/(n^2-x))-(1/((n^2-x)-1)) where x = the number of known positions in the row,
    where x is the number of known positions in the row, subgrid, and column

~~~~~~ Techniques ~~~~~~
A "house" is a subgrid, column, or row

Hidden Subsets
 - When two (or more) cells share a subset of candidates that no other cell in the "house" has
 - - Then we know the values must go in those cells, and we can remove the possibility of that value
      going into any other cell in the "house"
